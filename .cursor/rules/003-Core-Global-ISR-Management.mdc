rule_definition:
  description: "All interrupts must be handled through the centralized ISR handler."

  rules:
    - Do not handle GPIO interrupts directly in unrelated modules.
    - Register ISR callbacks through the shared `irq_handlers.cpp` dispatcher.
    - ISR callbacks must not allocate memory or block; delegate work to tasks via queues.
