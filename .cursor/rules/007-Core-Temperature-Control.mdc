  description: "Enforce temperature control and safety guidelines for the reflow oven."

  rules:
    - All temperature readings must be validated for reasonable ranges before use.
    - Temperature control loops must include safety limits and emergency shutdown conditions.
    - Temperature sensors must be checked for faults or disconnections.
    - PID control parameters must be tuned for each specific oven configuration.
    - Temperature profiles must be validated before execution.
    - All temperature-related operations must be logged for safety and debugging.
    - Emergency shutdown procedures must be implemented and tested.
    - Temperature control code must be isolated in dedicated services.
    - Temperature readings must be averaged over multiple samples to reduce noise.
    - Temperature control must account for thermal inertia and overshoot.
