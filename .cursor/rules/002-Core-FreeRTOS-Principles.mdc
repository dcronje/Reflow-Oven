  description: "Ensure FreeRTOS is properly used for multitasking."

  rules:
    - Use FreeRTOS tasks, queues, and semaphores for all asynchronous logic.
    - Use FreeRTOS features wherever possible.
    - Do not use `delay()`; use `vTaskDelay()` or timers instead.
    - Services should implement background logic with static FreeRTOS tasks.
    - Avoid blocking functions unless controlled within a FreeRTOS task.
