  description: Enforces general C++ and Raspberry Pi Pico SDK coding standards.
  rules:
    - Prefer using C++ classes over C-style code.
    - Avoid `malloc` and `new` where possible; prefer stack or static allocation.
    - Leverage the Pico SDK for hardware interaction (GPIO, PWM, I2C, SPI, etc).
    - Only use third-party libraries for hardware where Pico SDK lacks coverage or efficiency.
    - All FreeRTOS features (tasks, queues, semaphores) must use static allocation unless justified.
    - ISR code should be kept minimal and safe (no dynamic memory, minimal logic).
    - Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods and variables, CONSTANT_CASE for defines.
    - Maintain .h/.cpp file pairs in the same directory with matching filenames.
