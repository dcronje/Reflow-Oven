  description: "Ensure inheritance from provided base classes."

  rules:
    - All Views must inherit from `View`.
    - All Controllers must inherit from `Controller`.
    - All Models should inherit from `Model`.
    - Avoid implementing core interface logic directly in leaf classes.
    - Common controller/view/model behavior should be moved into shared base classes.
